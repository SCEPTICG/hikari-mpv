# sosc

A cross-platform mpv theme (Windows, Linux, macOS) built on top of [uosc](https://github.com/tomasklaen/uosc), with its own palette, thumbnails via [thumbfast](https://github.com/po5/thumbfast), and a few extras such as skipping anime openings and endings.

Work in progress.

## Palettes

sosc ships a palette picker for uosc. Open it with the palette button in the controls bar or `Alt+p`, then pick a palette; it is applied straight away.

- Dark: uosc (original), Catppuccin Mocha, Tokyo Night, Dracula, Nord, Gruvbox, Rosé Pine, Kanagawa, One Dark, Everforest.
- Light: Catppuccin Latte, Gruvbox light, Solarized light.
- Custom: SCEPTIC, defined in `portable_config/scripts/sosc-palettes.lua`.

A palette can also set transparency through an optional `opacity` table (uosc's `opacity` keys, values 0 to 1); palettes without it use uosc's default opacity.

sosc owns uosc's `color` and `opacity` options: values set in `script-opts/uosc.conf` are overridden by the active palette. Customise them by editing a palette instead.

The choice is saved to `~~/sosc-palette.conf` (the mpv config folder, `portable_config/` in a portable install), which `mpv.conf` includes on start-up. To bind another key, use `script-binding sosc_palettes/open-menu` in `input.conf`.

## Stream titles

When mpv plays an http(s) URL with a query string, such as the links Seanime hands out (`https://host/<id>?token=...&filename=Show.S01E01.mkv`), `sosc-title.lua` sets the title to the decoded `filename` parameter without its video extension, or to the last path segment when there is no `filename`. The token never reaches the top bar. Local files and URLs without a query keep mpv's own title, and a `force-media-title` you set yourself is left alone. The title only lasts for that file.

It also leaves alone playlist entries that carry their own title (M3U `#EXTINF`), and when there is no `filename` the path segment it falls back to (`stream`, `master.m3u8`...) gives way to the file's own `title` tag once the file has loaded.

Scope: this covers uosc's top bar and the window title. The full URL is still visible in uosc's playlist menu, in mpv's stats overlay, and in mpv's logs and `watch_later` files.

Disable it with `enabled=no` in `script-opts/sosc-title.conf`.

## Speed menu

The speed button in the controls bar opens a menu with 0.5×, 0.75×, 1×, 1.25×, 1.5× and 2×; the current speed is marked. mpv's own `[`, `]` and `Backspace` keep working. To open the menu from the keyboard, add a line like this to `input.conf`:

```
Alt+s  script-binding sosc_speed/open-menu
```
