# Stream titles

When mpv plays an http(s) URL with a query string, such as the links Seanime hands out (`https://host/<id>?token=...&filename=Show.S01E01.mkv`), `hikari-title.lua` sets the title to the decoded `filename` parameter without its video extension, or to the last path segment when there is no `filename`. The title is set as the file starts, so the token is kept out of the top bar except, at most, for an instant while the stream opens. Local files and URLs without a query keep mpv's own title, and a `force-media-title` you set yourself is left alone. The title only lasts for that file.

It also leaves alone playlist entries that carry their own title (M3U `#EXTINF`), and when there is no `filename` the path segment it falls back to (`stream`, `master.m3u8`...) gives way to the file's own `title` tag once the file has loaded.

Scope: this covers uosc's top bar and the window title. The full URL is still visible in uosc's playlist menu, in mpv's stats overlay, and in mpv's logs and `watch_later` files.

With `pretty=yes` (the default) a title taken from `filename` is tidied up: dots and underscores become spaces, release groups, hashes and technical tags go, and the episode marker is shown as `T<season> E<episode>` (T for *temporada*, season):

| `filename` | Title |
| --- | --- |
| `Reborn.as.a.Space.Mercenary.I.Woke.Up.Piloting.the.Strongest.Starship.S01E01.1080p.CR.WEB-DL.DUAL.AAC2.0.H.264.MSubs-ToonsHub.mkv` | `Reborn as a Space Mercenary I Woke Up Piloting the Strongest Starship · T1 E01` |
| `[SubsPlease] Sousou no Frieren - 05 (1080p) [ABCD1234].mkv` | `Sousou no Frieren · E05` |
| `Show.S01E01-E02.mkv` | `Show · T1 E01-E02` |
| `Show.S00E03.mkv` | `Show · Especial E03` (season 0 holds the specials) |
| `Movie.Name.2023.1080p.BluRay.x264.mkv` | `Movie Name (2023)` |

Recognised markers: `S01E01`, `s1e1`, `S01E01v2`, `S01E01-E02`, `E01`, `EP01`, `Episode 01` and anime-style ` - 01` / ` - 01v2`. A name with no marker is treated as a film and only cut at its first technical tag (resolution, source, codec, audio...); if nothing sensible is left, the name is shown as it comes. The path-segment fallback and playlist titles are never changed. A name written all in lower case, as some groups do (Erai-raws calls one series just `jukishi`), gets a capital first letter (`Jukishi · E15`); a name with any capital letter is left as it was written. Only the filename is available: the full series title (which Seanime knows) is not passed to mpv. Set `pretty=no` to get the filename as it comes, without its video extension.

Disable the whole script with `enabled=no` in `script-opts/hikari-title.conf`.
